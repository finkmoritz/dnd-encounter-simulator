# D&D Encounter Simulator

This is a simple D&D encounter simulator that I made for fun.
It's a simple program that simulates a D&D encounter between a party of adventurers and a group of monsters.

It helps you as a Dungeon Master to better balance multiple encounters in a campaign.

## Getting Started

Check out some of the test cases to get a hang of how the code works:

- [CurseOfStrahdArgynvostholt](src/test/kotlin/io/github/finkmoritz/dndencountersimulator/campaign/cos/CurseOfStrahdArgynvostholt.kt)
- [LostMinesOfPhandelver1](src/test/kotlin/io/github/finkmoritz/dndencountersimulator/campaign/lmop/LostMinesOfPhandelver1.kt)
